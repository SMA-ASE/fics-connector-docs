# SMA FICS Connector

The FICS Connector provides connectivity that allows an OpCon job to submit a request to FICS Mortgage Servicer. Running FICS Mortgage Servicer jobs or FICS Mortgage Accountant jobs can be accomplished by using the applications included in this toolkit. The exposed interface point (from FICS) is exposed in the form of web services. SMA Technologies provides the tools to allow users to craft request files and then submit them to the appropriate web service interface.
